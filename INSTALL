Installing on Linux and other POSIX systems
===========================================

Prerequisites:

        - The Qt library, version 5.x, including the QSerialPort component
        - A C++ compiler

Compilation:

        Unpack the source .tar.gz, or do "git clone git://github.com/bullestock/c45b.git"
        
        cd c45b
        qmake
        make

Installation:

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), I recommend
installing using

        sudo checkinstall --fstrans=no --pkgname=c45b --pkggroup=Electronics

This approach should also work on RPM-based systems (RedHat and derivatives), 
as well as Slackware, but I have not tried this.

Otherwise, simply do

        sudo install

If you want to install to another directory than the default, use something like

        qmake PREFIX=$HOME/software/
